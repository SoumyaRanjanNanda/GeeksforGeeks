#include<stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
   int a; 
   char *x; 
   x = (char *) &a; 
   a = 512; 
   x[0] = 1; 
   x[1] = 2; 
   printf("%dn",a);   
   return 0; 
}

output:-
Machine dependent


Explanation: 
Output is 513 in a little endian machine. To understand this output,
let integers be stored using 16 bits. In a little endian machine,
when we do x[0] = 1 and x[1] = 2, the number a is changed to 00000001 00000010
which is representation of 513 in a little endian machine.
