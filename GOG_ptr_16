#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{            //  0  1  2  3  4
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int *p = arr;
    ++*p;       //++*p  means *p++ is known as *p+1 ~ 1+1
    p += 2;     // p=p+2;  now p is at indexing number 0 then p address is increasing by 2 means 2*4 bytes now p is 3 (0 1 2 3 ) 
    printf("%d", *p); // 3  
    return 0;
}

output:-
 3
